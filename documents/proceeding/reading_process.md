# Reading Process

- Regular meeting time: **Wednesday** each week, two weeks a bunch of content.

- Suggested learning time: 1 WHOLE DAY each week (maybe Saturday or Sunday).

- Focus on the common comcepts, learn the courses yourself, e.g. automata and formal language; fundamentals of compiling, rigid methods, etc. Do not be too nervous about “what we can do”, but focus more on “what we can learn” first. After about 3 months of learning, it’s more confindent for us to say that “we are now no longer initials in this field and able to do some basic researches.”

- SKIM THE TEXTBOOK. It’s most recommended to use the textbook for an introduction to all the topics, but it’s better to learn using open-courses offered by colleges or video websites (like Bilibili in China mainland and Youtube otherwise).

- Week 1,2 (June 16):
